It seemed to me that the BTW abelian sandpile model is to the BTW abelian sandpile graph as Ising models are to Markov models. So what would be the analogy to Markov chains? I thought about it, and made something as simple and dumb as possible. It puts out some super interesting results, I felt. Is it discernable from a Markov chain, per se, statistically or whatever? I don't know.
